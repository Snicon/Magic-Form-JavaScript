# Magic-Form-JavaScript
Made as a project within the Hyperskill.org platform.

While the code is more or less spaghettiüçù at its finest my main foucs has been playing around with localStorage as that is something I have not had the chance to do before.

Users are able to write stuff into a form, upon refreshing the values in the form is "recovered"/still there until the form is submitted. When the form is submitted the form is cleared and the submition is saved and can be seen and deleted on another page (history.html). Additionally the form will sync across multiple tabs (if you update the contents of the form on one tab the other tab will update to reflect the updated one).
